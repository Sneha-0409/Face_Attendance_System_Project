# Face_Attendance_System_Project
This project automates daily attendance using face recognition and real-time detection. It captures and logs attendance with accurate time-stamping into a CSV file. By recognizing faces through a webcam and matching them with a pre-trained database, it ensures efficient, reliable, and contactless record-keeping.
